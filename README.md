## üìö Project Description

This project implements an automated pothole detection solution:
- A **YOLOv8 deep learning model** trained using **Darknet** architecture for high-accuracy detection.
- A **React + Vite** frontend for a responsive user interface.
- A **Python Flask** backend serving as an API layer between the model and the frontend.
  
Users can upload images or videos, view real-time detection results, and analyze pothole data in a clean, intuitive interface.
